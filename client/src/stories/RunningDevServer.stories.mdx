# Running the project

For ease of running, the container has been built and uploaded to dockerhub.
To run the image, make sure `docker-compose` is installed, and run the service using 
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

To get a better idea of how the app works, a init script has also been provided inside 
the server container.

In another terminal, find the name of the running container for the server.
This is likely `it5007-project_server_1`. Execute the following (replacing the container) name if its different:
```
docker exec -it it5007-project_server_1 sh
```
Ensure that you're in the server container by checking that it starts with `/server #`.
Then run the seeding script 
```
node ./seedMongoDB.js
```

If all goes well, the container should have some data seeded. Log in using the following.  
Username: `admin@nus`
Password: `admin`

The app should be running on port `3000` (Frontend served by express as it is now built)  
Documentation and information about our project can be found at `/docs`  
API endpoint documentation can be found at `/api-docs`  

## Starting a dev server
1. Install docker onto the target machine (with docker-compose)
2. Git clone the repository at [`https://github.com/IT5007-2220/course-project-meme-stack`](https://github.com/IT5007-2220/course-project-meme-stack)
3. `cd` into the root of the repository, e.g. `cd course-project-meme-stack`
4. Run the dev server using `./scripts/start_services_dev.sh` (Unix based systems only)

This development environment was made specifically for local development, where folders are 
mounted to local filesystem (and not just copied into the docker container) so that changes to the repository 
as made in the container do change in the local filesystem. This is so that all 3 containers can be updated and worked 
on. The repo and its relation can be visualised like so:

<img src={RepoRelation} />

REST API endpoints and their information have been made available at `http://localhost:<serverport>/api-docs` e.g. `http://localhost:3001/api-docs`

Likewise, mongodb is available locally at port `27017`.

In the dev environment, the admin user account is initiated and can be accessed via:
Username: `admin@nus`
Password: `admin`

## Production server
Starting the production server would require some configuration. From within the `client` folder,
run `yarn build`. This should build the react app into the servers public folder to be served should a 
user request the base path (ie. not `/api` or `/api-docs` path).

After, only the server container and the mongodb container needs to be run. This can be adapted from 
the `docker-compose.dev.yml`, in the repository as `docker-compose.prod.yml`, where we can remove the 
react container / server as it would be built into the server repo to be run.

To run the production server, the `SECRET_KEY` env variable needs to be defined in the docker-compose before building 
the required containers. The container is then tagged and committed before being pushed / deployed to cloud.

An example of such server is at [157.230.195.31](http://157.230.195.31) (or [https://it5007-group-memestack.antheajfwong.com/](https://it5007-group-memestack.antheajfwong.com/)) 
at the time of writing, where the deployment was completed by uploading `docker-compose.yml` - the final compose file that pulls 
from docker hub instead of rebuilding from this repository - and running them.

Deployment from local is therefore:  
* to run the production scripts at `scripts/start_services_prod.sh` which builds the react apps 
into `server/public` and initiates and creates the server containers; as well as runs the server to be tested
* If all looks good, then running `scripts/push_docker_hub.sh` which takes the latest built server container and pushes it to docker hub 

As the image is now on docker hub, `docker-compose.yml` can therefore be distributed onto server where the images can be automatically 
downloaded and run using `docker compose -f ./course-project-meme-stack/docker-compose.yml up --pull always -d` (changing the file path where appropriate).

It is recommended to set up firewall and reverse proxy such as `nginx` to proxy traffic from port `80` to port `3000` (such as implemented on the aforementioned server).
Firewalls are implemented to block traffic on all non `443`, `80` and `22` both on server provider and on server via nginx config.

It is also recommended to secure the machine using ssh keypair. 
In the machine above, traffic using ssh has been also been limited to allowed ssh keypairs for which the allowed 
machines with private keys resolving to the allowed public keys acknowledged by the server has been uploaded.
