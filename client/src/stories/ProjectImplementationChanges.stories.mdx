# Project Implementation & changes

## Change: Problem formulation
During implementation, we had faced quite a number of changes due to constraints. The first being the 
project problem itself. 

In our [initial problem formulation](?path=/story/archive-it5007-initial-project-problem-formulation--page), we 
had came to realize that the given that nusmods already implements a similar solution in the form of disqus. As 
there is little to distinguish our solution as a clear improvement over what is well-established source of information 
for module planning, we thought to pivot our solution to collecting that feedback over time. We liked the idea that 
more granular feedback is needed, however the form for which we receive that had changed as we discussed different 
methods to create incentives for seeking that feedback. This was how we have arrived at our current problem formulation 
of having it also be a lecture / teaching support tool for which the usage involves the lecturer. By involving and engaging 
all required parties, we create an avenue for which everyone has incentive to participate.

For the students, they would be able to submit questions and moderately anonymous feedback to demonstrate their current level 
of understanding on the topic. For the lecturers, they would be able to have ongoing feedback for the classes understanding on the module,
and elaborate and refine their syllabus more on the subjects for which the understanding is low on.

This was how we arrived at our current problem formulation, where we had pivotted wholely to creating a teaching-support tool 
to assist in engaging students and informing lecturer of the classes general understanding at any class.

## Change: Schema
From our project planning phase, the schema changed multiple times to support different functionalities.
For example, from our original schema, we had started to prioritize `User` and `Module` as we changed our definition of user from 
faculty and student to just faculty. This was due to NUS student login not having a readily integratable api, as well as that most 
students would be unlikely to wish to log in to go through the additional step to log in to participate. The barrier to engagement 
needed to be low to encourage interaction. In addition, we felt that partial anonymity would be beneficial in encouraging students to provide 
feedback of lack of understanding without being singled out and encourage objective feedback.

Second was that in defining User to be Lecturer, they would be the same people to select the modules for which is relevant to 
them that they are teaching, hence it would make most sense to associate the few modules that are relevant to the lecturers for which 
have an account created. To also support that some functionality require user input and association, some new attribute fields were 
added to User to create ephemeral anonymous user accounts for students. These can be forgone, however we felt this important to help 
track and avoid repeated rating submissions, hence an additional attribute `anonymous` was created for which these accounts have 
usernames tied to the unique session that was created by staff.

Over the course of the project implementation, our schemas have changed multiple times to facilitate API fetching as well and 
efficient storage as well as support real-time updates.

The final schemas and their relations can be found defined here in code:

## Implementation
Overall, our UI and user interaction flow had remained mostly the same as what we have envisioned 
in our revised project problem formulation. Hence during our implementation, the majority of changes and challenges were technical 
implementations and constraints and general errors such as machine differences.
