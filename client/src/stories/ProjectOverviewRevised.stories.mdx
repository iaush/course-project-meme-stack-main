# IT5007 Revised Project Problem Formulation

Lecturers often require ongoing student feedback to provide an effective 
learning experience. Likewise, Students also require a method to interact with 
and engage in course material to learn effectively. As such, we plan to have a solution 
to have lecturers and students to have a platform to ask questions and provide ongoing feedback 
for each session, as well as make it interactive so that lecturers would have a method to understand 
students understanding of each topic covered in a class.

## Is the problem relevant a year/2-years/5-years/10-years from now?

Learning is a constant requirement, and methods to engage students and to provide an effective 
learning experience is always a requirement. In 2 or 5 years down the road, we may imagine that 
crafting an engaging learning experience will still be relevant. The most likely challenge to this 
is the advancements made in AI, for which more effective forms of knowledge transfer may be made in other forms perhaps 10 
years down the road. However, like all web-based tools that exist today, advancements in AI are a welcome addition 
that can be integrated into the solution as that technology becomes more widely available and cost effective.

## What is the challenging aspect of the problem? Have others not thought of the problem or is the solution difficult to come up with?

There are few educational industry applications that implement similar tools, however none that we have found focused on 
the lecturers in terms of having a real-time method to ask students for their assessment of subject-based understanding and 
score tracking across a semester.

By providing a review of the subjects, questions relevant to each lecture and the general understanding of the students for each week, 
this will help lecturers focus on refining the syllabus. 

## What is your approach to solving it? What is novel about the solution?

Our approach is to create a web application where students can provide feedback and present questions in real-time for 
lecturers to identify gaps in understanding. The novel addition is the real-time element for doing so, as well as integrating 
the combination of a question / answer chat box and a subject / tag-base system to allow users to rate their understanding not just 
based on the general overview of the class; but specific subjects covered during.

For example, the lecturer may create a subject tag relevant to his/her current class, like 'React', 'JS', 'Networking';
and students will be able to give a rating (from 1-5) for each tag in real time to provide their level of understanding for each tag 
for that class. If the average of a particular subject tag score is low this week, the lecturer may be able to understand and 
refine their syllabus to cover a particular subject more next lecture or change the syllabus next semester to refine the syllabus.

This subject based feedback may then be able to help highlight what may be useful or what may require improvement over time.

## How will you prevent people from copying your solution? (would you patent it?)

Over the long term as our user base grows, our web application will be able to offer more information
and analytics, which later competitors would lack.
