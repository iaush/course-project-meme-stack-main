# IT5007 Initial Project Problem Formulation

Our idea for our project arose from a difficulty we faced as students in
deciding which modules to take. In the context of NUS, while there are
resources available such as NUSMods, we found that the information provided
was often insufficient to make an informed decision. Our solution is to create
a web application that makes it easy to crowd source information about modules
that we find are currently lacking such as syllabus, module workload and
how useful students found the module.

## Is the problem relevant a year/2-years/5-years/10-years from now?

We believe that the problem of insufficient information to make an informed
decision about one’s modules is a perennial one.

In the context of NUS, to find out important information such as syllabus,
teaching style and module workload, one would need to first register for the
class and then decide whether to drop it based on the course content of the
first two weeks.

However, this practice results in wasted time and effort on the part of the
student if the student ultimately decides to drop the module. Additionally,
this practice places pressure on faculty who are faced with logistical issues
if the size of their class changes drastically due to students adding or dropping
their module within this short time frame.

We believe that having more information available means students can are better
equipped to make informed decisions earlier, reducing the number of changes in
student enrolment for a module.

## What is the challenging aspect of the problem? Have others not thought of the problem or is the solution difficult to come up with?

One web application that aims to address this problem is NUSMods ([https://nusmods.com/](https://nusmods.com/)).
NUSMods provides useful information such as a short course summary and course prerequisites
and preclusions. However, in its aim to be a “complete knowledge bank of NUS modules by providing
useful module-related information such as community-driven module reviews and discussions”,
we find that it falls short. Currently, NUSMods uses an external forum service (Disqus) for students
to write reviews. While this format facilitates discussion, it results in inconsistencies in terms of
the review quality. Similarly, the ‘open-ended’ text format of the NUSMods forum often leads to large
chunks of text which makes it challenging to navigate through the NUSMods forum. In addition, due to
large variances in review formats, the quality of reviews tends to vary greatly as well. This makes it
difficult for users to identify elements that may be important to them as part of the decision-making process.

Another web application that provides a platform for students to submit reviews about their modules is
Rate My Professor ([https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/)). However,
this functions more as a review of a university or a particular faculty staff. As a result, students
who wish to find out more about a particular module would have to identify the faculty staff teaching
the module first. Moreover, because reviews are anonymous and because of the ‘open-ended’ text format
of the review creation, the quality of the reviews differs.

## What is your approach to solving it? What is novel about the solution?

Our approach is to create a web application where users can submit their reviews for modules that
they have taken. The web application will have a standardized format to module reviews where users
can easily get useful information about the modules (such as workload, difficulty, etc.) without having
to scroll through large paragraphs of text as is on NUSMods currently. The web application also hopes to
utilize the standardized review format to generate simple analytics such as student ratings over the semesters
etc to give users a quick and simple overview of the modules.

Likewise, our approach also hopes to implement a social aspect to it as well. Users often read module reviews
to best gauge the module suitability for the upcoming semesters; the web application will thus attempt
to link potential classmates by creating a common platform (telegram / discord API etc) for students
who are taking the same module in the upcoming semester to discuss about the module and form potential
groups to undertake the module together

User will have to create accounts and post reviews to view all aspects of the website such as accessing
all user reviews etc, which will hopefully reduce the number of low-quality post as well as encouraging
users to post their inputs rather than just consuming them alone.

## How will you prevent people from copying your solution? (would you patent it?)

Over the long term as our user base grows, our web application will be able to offer more information
and analytics, which later competitors would lack. Similarly, the database of reviews and module information
collected over time will lead to a more diverse and insightful understanding of the modules that other
websites will not be able to easily copy without directly referencing our proposed web application.
