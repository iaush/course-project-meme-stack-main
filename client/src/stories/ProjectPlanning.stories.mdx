# Project planning

## UI planning
In our planning phase, we had put together wireframes by collaborating and walking through 
the different elements and pages we will use for the application.

Below is one of the initial wireframes for putting together the different views from the 
viewpoints of different users that may interact with the platform.

## Schemas during planning
In addition, we had also created schemas to work with to be able to assign and work with data
schema in mind during development.

<img src={schema2} />

However upon implementation, we had to adapt our schema to fit different use cases, this is where 
flexibility played a part in helping us implement the project. [Change](/story/project-implementation-changes--page&args=#change-schema)
