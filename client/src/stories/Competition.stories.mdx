# Competition & Alternatives

There are a number of applications that we have found which focuses in the education 
space. Here are our findings:

| Product / Software              | Findings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/)   | This is one of the most popular applications for education.  Though it helps with boosting class engagement, the webapp is  mainly targeted and constrained to multiple choice questions and  answers that needs to be prepared in advance. There is no  option for users to submit any information to help with engagement.                                                                 |
| [Vevox](https://www.vevox.com/) | This is the closest application we have found in the application space.  There are polls, Q&A and star ratings component* to help engage students to  provide feedback. However from our research, we were unable to find any statistics  or reporting functions that help lecturers understand and review how the session  went for which our application has. \* At their $6.75/month plan |
| Quizlet, Quizizz, Gimlet, etc   | Most other applications in the education space primarily focus on quiz creation as  the primary approach to engaging user rather than asking for student feedback. Hence this is quite different from our application for which the primary focus  is to inform both teachers and students of the classes overall understanding at that  moment rather than at the end (e.g. during a quiz). |

As a result, we believe that there is no 1 to 1 alternative for our application in the market.
